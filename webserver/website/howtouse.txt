prerequisites
- have set up database, using the sql scripts in db
- have a linux webserver capable of running python scripts

notes on apache2 setup for python scripts
- an insecure but easy way to do this on a default apache2 installation on ubuntu
  is to edit /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default , and change the /var/www/ section as follows:

        <Directory /var/www/>
                Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews +ExecCGI
                AddHandler cgi-script cgi py
                AllowOverride None
                Order allow,deny
                allow from all
        </Directory>

setting up database
- change into db directory
- run "./createall.sh <dbusername> <dbpassword> <dbname> localhost"

setup
- the 'website' directory is the website, and should be published using apache or similar
- copy config.py.template to config.py
- configure config.py with the database connection settings for your database
- modify the admin password in the 'accounts' table in the database (default existing login: admin, password: 'admin')
- create a subdirectory 'replays' of the website directory, and ensure that apache can write to it (eg do "chmod +ugo w replays")
- you may wish to make sure that the .py files are executable, otherwise they may
  not execute correctly in cgi
