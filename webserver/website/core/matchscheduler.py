# The job of this module is to schedule matches for the various leagues.

# For now, initial first implementation, we will do the following:
# - for each league, take all ais
# - pair up
# - for each pair, check that the matchrequest table contains at least nummatchesperaipair
#   matches
# - otherwise schedule new ones
