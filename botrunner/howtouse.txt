what is this?
- it's the botrunner part of the ailadder
- it gets the specification of a single ai match to run from a webserver and runs it
- then it uploads the result to the webserver

prequirements
- python
- internet connection
- Spring
- some maps, mods
- just for info, this was tested on Ubuntu Jaunty

running botrunner:
- run "python botrunner.py"
- the first time you run it, it will ask you which webserver you wish it to subscribe to,
  the name you wish to give it, the shared secret, and it will try to find out the
  name of the spring executable
- it will then upload the available ais, maps, and mods to the webserver , ...
- ... and request a match to process from the webserver

You can follow the status of the botrunner through the website that you've subscribed to.
