Notes: 
- put description of each branch separately, different lines, so don't get merge cnoflicts
- when adding/changing lines, only add lines for the current branch, so don't get merge conflicts

configindb:
- moved configuration values, except for those needed to connect to database, into 
  new db table 'config'
