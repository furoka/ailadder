what is this?
- it's the calcengine part of the ailadder
- it gets the specification of a single ai match to run from a webserver and runs it
- then it uploads the result to the webserver
- at least, that's the goal, it doesn' quite do that yet ;-) but it almost does...

What it does at the momenet:
- downloads a request
- runs spring, determines the result
- does nothing with the result for now

prequirements
- python
- internet connection
- Spring
- just for info, this was tested on Ubuntu Jaunty

configuration:
- copy config.py.template to config.py
- set the directory of your spring installation in config.py
- you'll need to have the appropriate AIs, mods and maps installed for now, though clearly this would need to be handled automatically in the future...
- change the name of your calcengine and your shared secret in config.py

running calcengine:
- simply run calcengine.py
